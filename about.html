                    <h5>Hello!</h5>
                    <p>
                        My name is <b>Sebastian</b>. I am software developer and student at the Blekinge Institute
                        of Technology where I am studying for my Master's degree in Science and Engineering,
                        focusing on game technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have mainly worked in <span class="inline-code">C++</span> for my courses, mostly with
                        graphics programming and game development. I have taken a course in <span
                            class="inline-code">Python</span> <i>(aced it btw)</i>, and I have taught myself <span
                            class="inline-code">JavaScript</span> for the purposes of making this site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you can probably tell after having looked around the site, there is not much here yet.
                        Most of the work I have done is compiled code and thus is difficult to get running in <span
                            class="inline-code">html</span>. If you are interested in that, please have a look at my
                        <a href="https://github.com/SebLore">GitHub</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am working on a few projects that I will be able to show here soon. In the meantime,
                        please watch this slow loris eating a rice ball while you wait.
                    </p>
