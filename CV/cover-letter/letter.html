                <h4>Hello Hiring Team at Outpost24!</h4>
                <br>
                <p>My name is <b>Sebastian</b>, and I am a 29-year-old developer from Gothenburg, Sweden. I am currently
                    attending
                    my third year of my Master's Degree at the Blekinge Institute of Technology, specializing in game technology.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My fascination with technology started early; I interacted with my first PC at 3 years old and simply
                    never looked back. What started out as a love for computer games has blossomed into a wide appreciation for software, technology and problem solving. I
                    will never get tired of bringing my ideas to life with coding.</p>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Throughout my studies, I have gained exprience in data structures and algorithms, data communication,
                    and software architecture. While I do not yet have extensive experience with encryption or security, I am a quick and eager learner and am confident I would be able to get into the swing of things quickly.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My primary programming language is C++, as that has been the focus of most of my studies, but I have
                    experience in Java, Python and JavaScript. I have also worked with databases through MySQL and
                    Pandas as well as remotes through WSL and Docker.
                    While my background is in games programming, I believe my problem-solving skills and general programming
                    chops would make up the difference.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I enjoy learning new things and work well both under pressure, both on my own and with a team. I
                    have excellent communication skills and I am not afraid to ask questions when I do not understand something or raise concerns when I see them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Best regards,</p>
                <p><b>Sebastian Lorensson</b></p>
